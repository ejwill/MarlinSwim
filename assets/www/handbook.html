				<h3>Fun Day</h3>
					<p>
					    Fun Day happens the morning after every swim meet between 10:00 - 11:00 a.m. There are doughnuts, water polo, and games for all ages. Bring your floats!
					    Ribbons will be distributed during the last 15 minutes of Fun Day. There is no practice in the morning, but the regular evening practice schedule is
					    followed. Evening practice also received doughnuts and ribbons. There <em>is</em> Fun Day after the last meet.
					    <br/>
					    <em>

					            <br/>
					            Note to parents:
					        </u>
					    </em>
					    Fun Day is for swim team members only. There are no lifeguards on duty during this time period. Our coaches are responsible for the safety of the swimmers.
					    They cannot assume responsibility for younger siblings or friends. The playground and baby pool areas are usually open, but all children must be supervised
					    in those areas by their parents. Thank you for your cooperation.

				<h3>General Information</h3>
				    <p>
				        The Richmond Metropolitan Aquatic League (RMAL) has the following age divisions:
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        <strong>Mini-Mite - Six years old and under</strong>
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        <strong>Mite - Seven to eight years old</strong>
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        <strong>Midget - Nine to 10 years old</strong>
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        <strong>Junior - 11 to 12 years old</strong>
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        <strong>Intermediate - 13 to 14 years old</strong>
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        <strong>Senior - 15 to 18 years old</strong>
				    </p>
					<p>
						<div>
						    <p>
						        The cutoff date for aging up to the next age group is May 31. Any swimmer with a birthday during the summer after May 31 stays in the younger age group
						    Swimmers in each age division swim in three speed categories: Silver, Gold ,and Blue (the fastest category). When a swimmer swims a qualifying time, he/she
						    automatically moves to the next division for the next meet. These times are posted on the Swim &amp; Dive Bulletin Board.
							</p>
							<p>
							    It is ultimately the coaches’ decision as to when a mini-mite is ready to compete. To push a child to swim in a meet before he/she has reached an adequate
							    competency level can be counterproductive.
							</p>
							<p>
							    Go to <a href="http://www.swimrmal.org/">www.swimrmal.org</a> for access to league times, events, and other information.
							</p>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h3>Team Swim Suits and Attire</h3>
							<p>
							    Suits can be purchased through Disco Sports (www.discosports.com) located at 1400 Starling Drive, Richmond, VA 23229. The suits are in stock and can be
							fitted at any time. The suits will have to be left at the store to be embroidered and picked up later.    <em>One team cap will be distributed to each swimmer upon registration.</em> New t-shirts are only distributed to the whole team every other year. This
							    year all swimmers will receive a t-shirt.
							</p>
					</div>
					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h3>Practice Info</h3>
							<p>
							    There will always be at least two coaches at all practices. Morning practices are held on the days of swim meets. There is no practice during a storm with
							    thunder and lightning, but practice will be conducted if it is just raining. The most efficient way of contacting all swimmers regarding canceled practices
							    or delayed meet time due to bad weather is via e-mail. Please make sure we have your current e-mail address so you can receive up-to-date communication
							    from the swim committee and your coaches.
							</p>
							<p>
							    Each swimmer should arrive to practice at least 5 minutes prior to the start of practice. Swimmers should be ready to enter the water at their designated
							    practice time (this means with suit, swim cap and goggles). Swimmers should put forth maximum effort into every practice. Hard work and commitment is
							    rewarded with faster times throughout the season.
							</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Meet Day</h3>
						<p>
						    Swim meets start at 6:00 p.m. The pool closes at 4:00 p.m. on home meet days. Swimmers should arrive at the pool for warm-ups no later than 4:30 p.m. for
						    home meets and 5:00 p.m. for away meets. Home meet warm-ups are:
						</p>
						<ul>
						    <li>
						        <strong>4:45 to 5:00 p.m. </strong>
						         - Mini-mites, Mites, &amp; Midgets
						    </li>
						    <li>
						        <strong>5:00 to 5:15 p.m. </strong>
						        - Juniors, Intermediates, &amp; Seniors
						    </li>
						</ul>
						<p>On the day of a meet, swimmers should stay out of the sun, get plenty of rest, and maintain a healthy diet. Remember to bring nutritious snacks, towels, goggles, caps and a t-shirt to all swim meets. Spectators should bring chairs as they are at a premium during meets. Extra towels and sweat shirts can come in handy. Pay close attention to the coaches so that everyone can swim his/her BEST. Meets are conducted in rain, but lightning and/or thunder will cause delays. Swim meets are only canceled or postponed if thunder and lightning persist. </p>

						<p>Granite Marlins are expected to be models of good behavior, both at our pool and away meets. There is never an excuse for bad behavior and it will not be tolerated at practice or at meets. Please leave the pool area free of litter at home and away meets. We ask that the swimmers help set up for home meets (moving chairs) and clean up after the home meets (put chairs back).</p>
						
						<p>Swim meets require more participation from parents than most sports. Our goal is to start the season as organized as possible, and have the meets run smoothly and efficiently. Swim team parents are required to work a minimum of three meets (six halves) to ensure that our swim meets run smoothly, and are finished in a timely manner. Sign up to help with the various jobs that are needed. Home meets require more workers than away meets. Most jobs during a meet are divided into two shifts. Thank you for contributing your time and effort in support of a rewarding season for the Marlins. This year we are utilizing <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/">www.signupgenius.com</a> to streamline volunteer commitments. Please make yourself comfortable with this website AND make sure we have your correct email address.</p>
						
						<p>If your child is unable to swim the night of a swim meet, please let the coaches know as early as possible. This is important as all events are pre-seeded. No changes can be made to individual events after noon on the day of the meet. Furthermore, coaches need to be able to decide on the best strategy for putting together relays and individual medley participants. If you have to leave a meet before relays, please make sure your child is not in a relay. If one swimmer on a relay team is missing, the entire relay team has to be scratched.</p>

					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h3>Concessions</h3>
							<p>
							    At each home meet, the Marlins host a Bake Sale. Each swimmer should bring an item to sell. This is a major fund-raiser for us and helps to keep our fees
							    down. Home-baked dessert items are always the best sellers. It helps to individually wrap your items in sandwich baggies ahead of time, and please indicate
							    in writing if they contain nuts. Other popular items include: fruit cups, bagged baby carrots or grapes, boxes of raisin/craisins, energy bars (not
							    Nutrigrain as these are provided by concessions), single serve yogurt/jello/pudding cups, small bags of chips, cheese sticks, or trail mix. Just remember:
							    no glass containers and no gum.
							</p>

					<h3>Coaches Gift</h3>
						<p>
						    It has been our practice to present each of the coaches with a team gift at the banquet as a token of our appreciation for their dedication and hard work.
						    Please consider making a contribution toward these gifts. From past experience, we know that the coaches are especially grateful for this recognition of
						    their efforts. If you wish to contribute, please try to get your donation to <strong>Katie Baron</strong> before the swim banquet on 7/2/2013.
